        <p>I created an app using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript I had learned to build a restaurant order app with built in payment function.</p>

        <p class="bold-text">What I learned</p>
        <p> Most of what I learned while doing this project was how to use JavaScript to add data stored in an array as an object to a website and show it. The menu items and information were stored in an array and I used a forEach loop to show them on screen. I also learned how to add event listeners as well as use innerHTML to add text or html to the page using JavaScript.  </p>
        <p class="bold-text">What I found challenging</p>   
        <p>Although I completed the task mostly without any googling, I found the form submission difficult when I had to bring up the form in another box on screen to overlay on top of the menu and also get the form to submit with the data being required. I did want to use the name which was entered in the form within the confirmation message but I couldn't find a way to do it. However, after doing some more research, I know how to get the form data and use it in such a way. It is one thing I could do to update the app. What's more, after doing the latest Scrimba module, I could make this app more responsive so it can display on both laptop and mobile screens.</p>
